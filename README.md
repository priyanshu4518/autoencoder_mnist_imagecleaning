# MNIST Denoising Autoencoder
## Description
This project involves training a convolutional neural network (CNN) to denoise images from the MNIST dataset. The dataset is preprocessed by adding Gaussian noise to the images, and the model is trained to reconstruct the original images from the noisy inputs
